# Karura Dex Analysis

Planning to do a simple CLI daily volume analysis through query history state from karura node and event from karura subql.

### Expectation from here
The minimum expected analysis is getting volume in term of native of relay chain (KSM) between two currency.

The better analysis will be contained volume of inter-pair swapping (Ex the swapping of KSM in between KUSD-KAR), volume (24h) in USD value and trading fee (24h) collected.

The data may have 1% Â± mistake due to not exact history rate of pair, we define history rate from the liquidity at particular block number.

### Checklist
- [x] get ratio from liquidity pool
- [x] KSM price from oracle on specific block
- [x] today event query
- [x] 24 hours event query
- [x] 7 days event query
- [x] rough simple swap volume (KSM) calculation
- [ ] rough complex swap volume (KSM) calculation (involve more than two currency, by the time writing will be KAR->KSM->KUSD and KUSD->KSM->KAR)
- [ ] USD valued volume
- [x] Query liquidity on specific block
- [x] History rate base on liquidity pool
- [ ] Calculate liquidity fee return on pool (% value, apr)
- [ ] price of token (calculated from liquidity pool with KSM as base)
- [ ] volume changed
- [ ] liquidity data by token

### Current Status
Currently trade data only calculated in KSM value, as mentioned above, complex swap is skipped.

There is two sample scripts:
- `npm run 7days`: take around 40 seconds query 7 days events and compute data
- `npm run 24hours`: take around 8 seconds query 24 hours events and compute data

Here is the sample result
```
npm run 7days
```
```

### Future
These are possible future of current repo:
- evolve into graphql api or nestjs api with mongodb
- expanded feature with web UI
- replace by official repo with similar function
